The Truth about Learning Neural Networks 1 The brain is

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:08.912
a network of connections between neurons 2 The brain contains

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:11.475
a large number of glial cells that do not generate

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.200
electrical signals and lack the developmental potential of neurons 3

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.663
Information in the brain is not isolated but interconnected 4

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.562
Everything you learn is useful and everything you learn is

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:28.475
interconnected 5 All scientists have hobbies unrelated to their well-known

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.987
field 6 Metcalfe's Law The value of individual nodes in

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:35.275
a network is proportional to the square of the total

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.375
number of nodes 7 The truth about learning is 1

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:43.312
The more you learn the better because everything you learn

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:47.050
is useful 2 The more you learn the more valuable

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.112
the knowledge you have already acquired becomes 3 The more

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:54.725
you learn the easier faster and more effortless learning becomes

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:58.175
