first components of speaking well 4 Parents should tirelessly explain

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:22.613
things 5 To have clear logic you need to organize

00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:27.113
your thoughts deliberately 6 The best education parents can give

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:31.700
their children is reading aloud 7 When reading aloud engage

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.975
as many senses as possible 8 Reading aloud enhances the

can share the good content they've read and ask their

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:17.737
children what they've learned today 16 A simple way to

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:22.362
