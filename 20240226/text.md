学习的真相：改良构建
1. 所有的抽象知识都是由两个要素构成的：
    1. 清晰准确必要的模型
    2. 以及，这些清晰准确必要的模型之间的清晰准确必要的关联
2. 大脑是一个基于记忆预测的系统
3. 一切抽象知识的学习就是：习得，应用，改良，构建模型的过程
4. 大脑只在意自己能够熟练控制的东西
5. 努力的模型：短时间内足量的重复
6. 对成年人来说所谓的学习只不过是：认真阅读说明书
7. 知识点的模型：主体、机制、用法
8. 学习的模型：学、练、用、造
    1. 起始→求学→练习→应用→创造→成功
9. 我们想要的是基于生产的教育，一切的生产都依赖习得非天生的技能
    1. 生产只能基于学习
10. 任何学习都会触发更多的学习
11. 呵护自己的创造的欲望，培养自己的创造的能力
12. 创造必然需要多个组合技能
13. 只有创造才能最大程度的反复触发学习，只有创造才是最终检验学习的最佳手段
14. 检验一个模型好坏：一个好的模型应该是清晰准确必要，不是必要的就应该被删除
15. 若干个子模型放在一起是无需增减的

The Truth About Learning: Improved Construction
1. All abstract knowledge comprises two elements:
   1. Clear, precise, and essential models
   2. Clear, precise, and essential connections between these models
2. The brain is a memory-based prediction system.
3. Learning all abstract knowledge entails the process of acquisition, application, improvement, and construction of models.
4. The brain only cares about what it can proficiently control.
5. Effortful models: Adequate repetition within a short timeframe.
6. For adults, "learning" is essentially akin to thoroughly reading an instruction manual.
7. Models of knowledge points: Subject, Mechanism, Application.
8. Learning model: Study, Practice, Apply, Construct.
   1. Initiation → Study → Practice → Application → Creation → Success
9. We desire education based on production, which relies on the acquisition of non-innate skills.
   1. Production can only be based on learning.
10. Any learning triggers further learning.
11. Nurture the desire for creation and cultivate the ability for creation.
12. Creation inevitably requires a combination of multiple skills.
13. Only through creation can learning be maximally and repeatedly triggered. Creation is the ultimate test of learning.
14. To evaluate a model's quality: A good model should be clear, precise, and essential; if it's not essential, it should be removed.
15. Several sub-models together should remain unchanged.

Jane, a bright young girl, loves to read books at leisure in rooms or play on a sunny day outdoor here and there with boys. She vowed to buy a red ear dog. She thought it was unique, for sure. She'll feed it dough and cheese bar. She'll love it very much.
