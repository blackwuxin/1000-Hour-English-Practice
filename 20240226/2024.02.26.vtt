The Truth About Learning Improved Construction 1 All abstract knowledge

00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:11.625
comprises two elements 1 Clear precise and essential models 2

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:16.738
Clear precise and essential connections between these models 2 The

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:21.488
brain is a memory-based prediction system 3 Learning all abstract

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:26.000
knowledge entails the process of acquisition application improvement and constr-
uction

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.587
of models 4 The brain only cares about what it

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:34.987
can proficiently control 5 Effortful models Adequate repetition within a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.612
short timeframe 6 For adults learning is essentially akin to

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:44.263
thoroughly reading an instruction manual 7 Models of knowledge points

00:00:52.388 --> 00:00:58.163
1 Initiation Study Practice Application Creation Success 9 We desire

00:00:58.188 --> 00:01:01.487
education based on production which relies on the acquisition of

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:05.900
non-innate skills 1 Production can only be based on learning

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:11.475
10 Any learning triggers further learning 11 Nurture the desire

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.175
for creation and cultivate the ability for creation 12 Creation

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.487
inevitably requires a combination of multiple skills 13 Only through

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:26.213
creation can learning be maximally and repeatedly triggered Creation is

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:30.487
the ultimate test of learning 14 To evaluate a model's

00:01:30.513 --> 00:01:33.975
quality A good model should be clear precise and essential

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.225
if it's not essential it should be removed 15 Several

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.562
sub-models together should remain unchanged
