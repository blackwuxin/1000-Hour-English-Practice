The truth about learning the art of teaching 1 Teaching

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:07.300
is the best method of learning 2 When I know

00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:10.912
what I must learn I start teaching right away 3

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.662
Teaching forces me to learn everything thoroughly deeply and excellently

00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:19.488
raising my own standards 4 Teaching is essentially just rephrasing

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:24.788
5 Basic requirements for being a teacher 1 It's not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
about being know-it-all but about never making mistakes within the

00:00:27.712 --> 00:00:30.512
scope of instruction whether it's ten minutes half an hour

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.812
an hour or two hours no one can listen continuously

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:37.712
for longer 6 Anyone can excel at something as long

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.862
as they prepare diligently 7 The true essence of teaching

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:46.575
lies in its manifestation through repetition 8 The most significant

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.675
aspect of teaching is the process of answering questions 1

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:53.900
It's a rare opportunity to receive feedback and discover one's

00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:58.237
own shortcomings 2 Answering questions helps fill in the gaps

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.025
and correct mistakes 9 My own lessons have been the

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:05.162
most helpful to me 10 When I want her to

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.275
learn something I run to her and ask her to

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:12.000
teach me 11 How to prepare for a lesson 1

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.275
Never make mistakes within the scope of instruction 12 At

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.487
home I take on the role of a coach 1

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.500
Coaches ask more and speak less 2 Before the student

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:28.925
completes their input identify easily misunderstood or missed knowledge 3

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.263
Test the student's learning through questioning 4 Provide further supervision

00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:39.037
5 Use any means necessary including coaxing and trickery to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.862
ensure sufficient repetition within a short period 6 Another task

00:01:43.888 --> 00:01:48.562
of supervision is error correction 13 The core significance of

00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:55.188
repetition 1 Improve proficiency in tasks 2 Gradually correct all

00:01:55.213 --> 00:02:00.300
errors 14 Teacher's manuals previewing and reviewing are the best

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:05.612
supplementary materials 15 Artificial language vs. natural language
