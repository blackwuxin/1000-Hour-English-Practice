The truth about learning: the art of teaching
1. Teaching is the best method of learning.
2. When I know what I must learn, I start teaching right away...
3. Teaching forces me to learn everything thoroughly/ˈθɜːrəli/, deeply, and excellently, raising my own standards.
4. Teaching is essentially just rephrasing /ˌri'frez/.
5. Basic requirements for being a teacher:
    1. It's not about being "know-it-all," but about "never making mistakes within the scope of instruction"—whether it's ten minutes, half an hour, an hour, or two hours... no one can listen continuously for longer.
6. Anyone can excel at something as long as they prepare/prɪˈper/ diligently/ˈdɪlɪdʒənt/.
7. The true essence of teaching lies in its manifestation through repetition.
8. The most significant aspect of teaching is the process of answering questions.
    1. It's a rare opportunity to receive feedback and discover one's own shortcomings.
    2. Answering questions helps fill in the gaps and correct mistakes.
9. My own lessons have been the most helpful to me.
10. When I want her to learn something, I run to her and ask her to teach me.
11. How to prepare for a lesson? Never make mistakes within the scope of instruction.
12. At home, I take on the role of a coach.
    1. Coaches ask more and speak less.
    2. Before the student completes their input, identify easily misunderstood or missed knowledge.
    3. Test the student's learning through questioning.
    4. Provide further supervision /ˌsuːpərˈvɪʒn/.
    5. Use any means necessary, including coaxing/kəu'æksiŋ/ and trickery /'trɪkəri/, to ensure sufficient repetition within a short period.
    6. Another task of supervision is error correction.
13. The core significance/sɪɡˈnɪfɪkəns/ of repetition:
    1. Improve proficiency/prəˈfɪʃnsi/ in tasks.
    2. Gradually /ˈɡrædʒuəli/ correct all errors.
14. Teacher's manuals, previewing, and reviewing are the best supplementary /ˌsʌplɪˈmentri/ materials /mə'tiəriəlz/.
15. Artificial language vs. natural language.
