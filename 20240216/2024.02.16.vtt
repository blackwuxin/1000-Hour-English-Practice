The Truth About Learning Symbol Systems 1 All knowledge is

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:08.750
essentially a series of symbol systems 2 The illusion of

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:13.225
difficulty traps 3 What how why only how is what

00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:16.363
you need to learn and learning how requires rote memorization

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.325
4 Rote memorization is the hard work of learning 5

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:27.200
Repetition in abundance solidifies neural connections 6 Sufficient repetition i-
n

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.825
a short period 7 If I don't learn this thing

00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:34.675
I'll be at a disadvantage 8 The so-called effort is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.763
nothing more than finding ways to achieve sufficient repetition in

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:40.275
a short period and if either short or sufficient is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.812
not done then it's not enough effort 9 Clear definitions

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:45.975
with no ambiguity
