The Truth about Learning 1 It's designed for proponents of

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:08.550
development not proponents of design 2 In the long run

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:12.412
development surpasses design it not only has limitations but can

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.163
even be impossible Goals are for the short term while

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:19.938
direction is for the long term Achieving goals depends on

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:25.125
execution while continuous development relies on a solid foundation Achieving

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.812
goals emphasizes steps while continuous development values choices 3 Learning

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.075
is an ongoing process that spans generations 4 The goal

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.188
is not to immediately improve a child's academic performance or

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:42.112
create child prodigies 5 The goal is to make parents

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.675
understand the truth about learning so they can teach their

00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:48.150
children because teaching is the best way to learn This

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.438
in turn transforms parents and the people their children encounter

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:55.575
throughout their lives into learning assistants It's a role switch

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.038
6 Enable learners to become useful individuals as early as

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.050
possible 7 Education should be production-oriented and at its core

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:09.188
8 Start production early to cover one's cost of living

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:14.425
9 Learning is the prerequisite for production 10 We need

00:01:14.438 --> 00:01:18.725
to learn how to proactively produce and organize production 11

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:23.713
Learning is simple very simple indeed 12 A person's operating

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:28.888
system consists of two essential elements Clear accurate and necessary

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:35.412
concepts Clear accurate and necessary connections between these concepts 13

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:38.800
Are there enough clear accurate and necessary concepts in one's

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:43.150
mind and are there enough connections between these concepts 14

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:47.938
A concept What does this concept mean What is its

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.362
purpose How is it used How is it related to

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:57.550
other concepts 15 After understanding this fact what behaviors will

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:01.225
change or must change How were things before and how

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.888
will they be after Write down these changes in detail

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:08.825
How can I convey this fact principle or concept to

00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:09.475
my family
