00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.162
Transforming my lifestyle through learning As long as I invest

00:00:04.188 --> 00:00:06.487
time and effort there's nothing I can't learn in the

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.950
long run The more I learn the faster I'll grasp

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.488
new things Learning is not the end goal it's about

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
applying knowledge because value can only be realized through creation

00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:20.462
I know I may appear clumsy now but everyone starts

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:25.025
that way With practice it becomes natural and improves naturally

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:28.712
It's normal for others not to understand my dedication to

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.275
learning I don't need their understanding because I am an

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:35.388
independent individual I shouldn't argue with others because I don't

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.712
want to hurt them and I shouldn't let them influence

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.450
me because I don't want to harm myself Deliberate practice

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:45.175
is always necessary even if it's uncomfortable as its compounding

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:49.337
effects are tremendous Even for the sake of future generations

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.025
I must become a learning expert through my current efforts

00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:55.725
so I can grow alongside my children My journey is

00:00:55.737 --> 00:00:58.737
still long I want to be healthy I want to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.175
be clean especially in my mind I want it to

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:01.725
be clean
