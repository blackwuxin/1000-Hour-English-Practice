For most people the greatest challenge in reading isn't about

00:00:02.938 --> 00:00:07.638
speed comprehension or memory these are just excuses The real

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.050
issue lies in the inability to finish a book The

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:14.037
true problem is the inability to progress and complete reading

00:00:14.312 --> 00:00:18.762
not efficiency or elegance The foolproof method assumes that everyone

00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:21.675
struggles and tends to retreat in the face of difficulties

00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:25.637
Therefore it aims to help individuals complete even a small

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.850
portion of reading fostering confidence step by step It also

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:34.250
ensures this confidence doesn't lead to overconfidence The focus is

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:38.237
on steady progress rather than speed or efficiency It may

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.875
seem foolish to assume someone can only manage to read

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.125
ten pages a day But the real answer lies in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.000
becoming someone who can finish a book Reading ten pages

00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:50.800
daily repeating them ten times is the method
