00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.062
The truth about learning Energy-saving mode 1 Worries about energy

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:10.875
consumption 2 Every process in the brain requires energy 3

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:15.775
The brain naturally switches to energy-saving mode 4 Mental work

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.188
consumes more energy 5 Two inherent key modes of learning

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:26.337
1 Learning on demand just enough 2 Recycle and reuse

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.800
6 It all comes down to the willingness to learn

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:34.087
only willing to learn what is necessary 7 Time always

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:37.775
passes by on its own 8 The desire for quick

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:42.288
results is wishful thinking 9 To counteract the natural learning

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:45.763
obstacles caused by the brain's learning on demand mechanism we

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:51.425
have two means 1 Actively or passively employing coercion 2

00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:55.925
Actively or passively raising the standards of learning 10 The

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.462
brain is an inexhaustible resource 11 Regardless of what we

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:05.075
learn it's like building more neural connections 12 The earlier

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.650
the establishment of neural connections the easier it is 13

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:13.713
Established neural connections can be utilized through recycling and reusing

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.025
14 Recycling and reusing rewards overlearning and strong connections are

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:24.662
formed through overlearning 15 The ultimate advice for learning 1

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:29.275
Learn more the more the better 2 Practice more the

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:33.388
more the better 16 The more the better
