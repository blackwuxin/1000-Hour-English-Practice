00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.237
1 What are some effective learning methods Deliberate practice Practicing

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.025
in the learning zone Break it down Breaking tasks into

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.012
smaller units and practicing each one repeatedly Timely feedback Assessing

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:19.413
learning progress providing self-feedback doing exercises recording audio writi-
ng articles

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:24.913
for public feedback High focus during practice sessions 2 How

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:30.350
to execute these methods specifically Deliberately identify areas that require

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:37.350
practice Repeat repeat and repeat Comprehensive approach Read multiple books

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.562
on the same topic Read even if you don't fully

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:46.263
understand and then read multiple times Summarize organize and consolidate

00:00:46.288 --> 00:00:49.375
knowledge on your own Teaching is the best way to

00:00:49.388 --> 00:00:54.300
learn 3 What are some important considerations during the execution

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.663
process Don't expect to learn after just one read repetition

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:02.112
is key If you come across references that are too

00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:06.588
advanced don't be afraid Read through them quickly then reread

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:10.713
repeatedly Self-learning is a skill that doesn't rely on talent

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.550
or intelligence but on investing time deliberate practice and deliberate

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:19.263
thinking Allocate sufficient time one year three years five years

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:24.150
ten years a lifetime Be self-driven all skills are essential

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:29.263
4 How to assess learning effectiveness Produce a decent piece

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:32.475
of work write a book create a tutorial teach others

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:35.625
Seek public feedback through publication
