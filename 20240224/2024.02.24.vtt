00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.675
The Truth of Learning Model Matching 1 All recognition is

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:10.500
about matching models 2 Models are abstractions of things 3

00:00:10.662 --> 00:00:14.738
The brain predicts based on memory not precision 4 The

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:18.900
brain's process approximating predictions based on familiar and commonly used

00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:24.375
abstract models subject to validation or correction 5 Models constructed

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.325
for abstract concepts 6 Due to various reasons humans acquire

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.612
and accumulate a vast amount of abstract concept models using

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:36.163
them to build more abstract concept models thereby greatly changing

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:38.737
/ improving themselves and the world they rely on for

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.962
survival 7 For instance what is a circle A shape

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:46.163
where the distance from the center to any point on

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:51.013
the circumference is equal 8 Science is fundamentally about unambiguous

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.150
accurate and simple abstractions of the entire world
