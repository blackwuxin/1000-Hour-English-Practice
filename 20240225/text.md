学习的真相：记忆容量
1. 知识确实是由信息构成的，正如房子是由砖头建成的一样，然而正如一堆砖头放在那里不会自动成为房子一样，仅仅是信息的陈列无法直接构成知识。
2. 大脑是基于记忆的预测系统，贝叶斯推理机
3. 记忆储备越低，可用于预测的信息越少
4. 对人类的大脑来说，记忆的核心是信息之间的关联，没有被关联起来的信息无法属于记忆
5. 短时间内足量重复，尽量不要建立不必要的关联
6. 最重要提高记忆的手段：不断扩大知识量
7. 大脑皮层里一切都是网络，知识网络越大， 节点越多
8. 学得越多，就学得越好越容易
9. 记得越多，就记得越好越容易
10. 学习会让人变得更聪明

The Truth About Learning: Memory Capacity
1. Knowledge is indeed composed of information, much like how a house is made of bricks. However, just as a pile of bricks doesn't automatically become a house, merely presenting information doesn't directly form knowledge.
2. The brain operates as a prediction system based on memory, akin to a Bayesian inference engine.
3. The lower the memory reserve, the less information available for prediction.
4. For the human brain, the essence of memory lies in the connections between information. Information that isn't linked cannot be considered part of memory.
5. Adequate repetition within a short timeframe is crucial, while unnecessary associations should be minimized.
6. The most effective way to improve memory is through continually expanding one's knowledge base.
7. Within the cerebral cortex, everything functions as a network. The larger the knowledge network, the more nodes it encompasses.
8. The more you learn, the better and easier it becomes to learn.
9. The more you remember, the better and easier it becomes to remember.
10. Learning makes individuals smarter.

Jane, a bright young girl, loves to read books at leisure in rooms or play on a sunny day outdoor here and there with boys. She vowed to buy a red ear dog. She thought it was unique, for sure. She'll feed it dough and cheese bar. She'll love it very much.
