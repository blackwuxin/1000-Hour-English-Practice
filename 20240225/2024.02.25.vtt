The Truth About Learning Memory Capacity 1 Knowledge is indeed

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.537
composed of information much like how a house is made

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.162
of bricks However just as a pile of bricks doesn't

00:00:11.188 --> 00:00:15.338
automatically become a house merely presenting information doesn't directly for-
m

00:00:15.363 --> 00:00:19.650
knowledge 2 The brain operates as a prediction system based

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:24.000
on memory akin to a Bayesian inference engine 3 The

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:27.762
lower the memory reserve the less information available for prediction

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.475
4 For the human brain the essence of memory lies

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.975
in the connections between information Information that isn't linked cannot

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:40.337
be considered part of memory 5 Adequate repetition within a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.425
short timeframe is crucial while unnecessary associations should be minimized

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.125
6 The most effective way to improve memory is through

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:53.438
continually expanding one's knowledge base 7 Within the cerebral cortex

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:57.737
everything functions as a network The larger the knowledge network

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:01.525
the more nodes it encompasses 8 The more you learn

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.263
the better and easier it becomes to learn 9 The

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.900
more you remember the better and easier it becomes to

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:11.800
remember 10 Learning makes individuals smarter
