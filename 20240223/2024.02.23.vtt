The Truth about Learning Endless Possibilities 1 The brain's cortex

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.950
constantly explores boundaries 2 With repeated practice skills become internali-
zed

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:15.400
and second nature 3 The cortex only cares about organs

00:00:15.425 --> 00:00:19.700
it can control 4 Anything that improves finger dexterity is

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:23.988

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:38.800
you don't use 8 Beware of convenience traps 9 Our

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:42.638
ultimate goal is a healthy brain 10 The wealth gap

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.450
in knowledge will continue to widen
