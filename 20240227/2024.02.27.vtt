00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.112
The truth about learning outdated practices 1 Various models of

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:10.537
learning 1 All learning involves building the brain's cortex 2

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:15.500
Most learning is simply reading instruction manuals 3 All learning

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:19.925
actually falls under the same subject language arts 4 All

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.562
scientific knowledge is acquired through the study of artificial language

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.550
5 All learning is essentially the study and application of

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:32.875
symbolic systems 6 All learning is just about establishing reinforcing

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:37.650
and strengthening connections between neurons 7 All learning is about

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:42.263
constructing a network of knowledge 8 The most effective excessive

00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:46.688
learning is learning more natural languages 9 All learning is

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:51.862
comprised of seeking practicing applying and creating 10 There will

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:56.312
definitely be more in the future 2 Viral characteristics of

00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:03.100
erroneous learning models 1 Inability to directly experience consequences 2

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:08.537
Tendency to overlook contradictory evidence 3 Learning is actually simple

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.588
the human brain is a super learning machine 4 Most

00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:19.600
common tactics of mental control 1 Exaggerating difficulties 2 Belittling

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:27.987
others 3 Claiming authority 4 Repetitive intimidation 5 Neglecting soft

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.975
skills excessively focusing on competition and horizontal comparisons 6 Parents

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.487
should transform themselves into learning machines 1 Create their own

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:43.513
learning models through studying applying and creating 2 Turn teachers

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:49.213
and classmates into learning assistants 3 Previewing reviewing and paraphrasing

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:52.787
should be done with parents 7 School is not the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.862
place for learning learning is our own responsibility and it

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:59.213
can be done at home 1 The primary role of

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:03.350
school is for children to acquire social skills 8 Create

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.862
the optimal learning environment within the family an environment filled

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:09.412
with individuals who excel in learning and have a passion

00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:09.812
for it
