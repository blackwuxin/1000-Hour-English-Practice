The Truth About Learning Build and Maintain a Healthy Brain

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:07.800
1 When humans are born their cerebral cortexes are similar

00:00:08.688 --> 00:00:13.325
2 Research in neuroscience has revealed two facts 1 At

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.463
birth the brain and body are in a state of

00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:20.025
potential development 2 At birth the brain is already equipped

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:24.887
with enough models and mechanisms 3 Development promotes learning and

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:30.375
learning promotes development 4 Brain-building means constructing one's own cer-
ebral

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.388
cortex 5 Ultimately a person's performance depends only on the

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:39.400
length and quality of their learning 6 Time value =

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:43.575
time length x time quality 7 To successfully build the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.800
brain it is important to continuously keep the brain healthy

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:50.075
8 Everything we do in our lives happens in the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.013
cerebral cortex and our time should be spent building a

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:57.475
larger cerebral cortex 9 We also need to exercise and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.487
maintain its health
